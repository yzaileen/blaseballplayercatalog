An (incomplete) list of blaseball players and their statistics

awesome cool sexy wow

anyways this is what the program does at the moment:

stores a blaseball player's page and all the information on the official blaseball.com website, excluding current vibe

it will print out that player's page if asked*

it allows you to add new players to the existing lists

it allows you to search up a player's ID number**

*keep in mind that when prompted to type in player name/team name, each word has the be spelled correctly and capitalized with appropriate spaces.

**not an official blaseball thing. in this program all the players are assigned an ID number which is their fate number times the length of their soulscream

things I'm working on:

getting all the players into the lists

a way to edit player pages

here's how the list system or whatever works, btw. 

there's a main txt document (blaseballleague.txt) that has all the players added in the format name!id!team

every team has their individual txt document (teamname.txt, teamname is the team's name but all lowercase and no spaces). the team txt documents have all the player's information in the format id!letter!information where letter is a letter that represents a point of information like batting score or pregame ritual. information is the information recorded.

batting stars are recorded as a number like 1 or 3.5

aside from the stuff on the blaseball.com page, there's also a value that records the player's current position, which is either "batter/lineup" or "pitcher/rotation"
